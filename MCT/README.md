# Beer Project 

In this task we are creating a beer project  after searching for beer names we get a beer list and a reset button to reset all data. 
First of all, we created an HTML file for for basic structure nav hero section and footer. Now for styling, we are using CSS and for data and functionality, we are using JavaScript and fetch() the data punk API.

${percent} This is used for the alcohol percentage.
${item.name}  This is access for a beer name.
${item.image_url} This is for getting beer images.
${item.tagline} This is used for product tagline access.

All the above methods are used to access data in punk API.
